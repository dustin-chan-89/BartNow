###BartNow!

##A BART web application that serves up trip information faster than going to bart.gov without needing to download an app

#About
BartNow is a responsive, single page application that sends XMLHttpRequests to the official BART API. It grabs origin and destination information from the user, parses a QuickPlanner query and displays trip information based on the current time.

JavaScript cookie strings are saved and parsed to remember a user's commute information. When the same user returns to the website, their commute choices are saved and can be reversed with a single button.
